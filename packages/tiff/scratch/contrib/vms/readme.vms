Installation and use of the TIFF library and tools under VMS

It is assumed that you have unpacked the tar file into a VMS directory tree,
in this text called DISK:[TIFF].

Installation:
1) Move the VMS specific files to their proper directories
    $ SET DEFAULT DISK:[TIFF.CONTRIB.VMS]
    $ RENAME [.LIBTIFF]*.* [-.-.LIBTIFF]
    $ RENAME [.TOOLS]*.* [-.-.TOOLS]
2) Compile the library
    $ SET DEFAULT DISK:[TIFF.LIBTIFF]
    $ @MAKEVMS
3) Compile the tools
    $ SET DEFAULT DISK:[TIFF.LIBTIFF]
    $ @MAKEVMS
4) Define the programs
    $ DEFINE TIFFSHR DISK:[TIFF.LIBTIFF]TIFFSHR
    $ TIFFCP    :==$DISK:[TIFF.TOOLS]TIFFCP
    $ TIFFCMP   :==$DISK:[TIFF.TOOLS]TIFFCMP
    $ TIFFINFO  :==$DISK:[TIFF.TOOLS]TIFFINFO
    $ TIFFDUMP  :==$DISK:[TIFF.TOOLS]TIFFDUMP
    $ TIFF2PS   :==$DISK:[TIFF.TOOLS]TIFF2PS
    $ TIFFDITHER:==$DISK:[TIFF.TOOLS]TIFFDITHER
    $ TIFF2BW   :==$DISK:[TIFF.TOOLS]TIFF2BW
    $ TIFFMEDIAN:==$DISK:[TIFF.TOOLS]TIFFMEDIAN
    $ FAX2TIFF  :==$DISK:[TIFF.TOOLS]FAX2TIFF
    $ GIF2TIFF  :==$DISK:[TIFF.TOOLS]GIF2TIFF
    $ PAL2RGB   :==$DISK:[TIFF.TOOLS]PAL2RGB
You will want to add these lines to your LOGIN.COM file, after changing the
name of the directory that you have used on your machine.


Linking your own program to the TIFF library

You can link to a library in two ways: Either using the shareable library,
or using the object library. This gives the following possibilities

1) Using the shareable TIFF library
    $ LINK MY_PROGRAM,DISK:[TIFF.LIBTIFF]TIFF/OPTIONS

2) Using the TIFF object library and shareable C run time library
    $ LINK MY_PROGRAM,DISK:[TIFF.LIBTIFF]TIFF/LIBRARY,SYS$INPUT/OPTIONS
        SYS$SHARE:VAXCRTL/SHAREABLE

3) Using the TIFF object library and object C run time library
    $ LINK MY_PROGRAM,DISK:[TIFF.LIBTIFF]TIFF/LIBRARY,-
        SYS$LIBRARY:VAXCRTL/LIBRARY

(You may think of a fourth possibility, but that is not possible)

Method 1 uses the shortest link time and smallest .EXE files, but it requires 
that TIFFSHR is defined as above at link time and *at*run*time*.

Method 2 gives somewhat longer link time and .EXE files, but does not require
TIFFSHR to be defined.

Method 3 gives even longer link times and .EXE files, it not recommended unless
you are going to use your program on a machine without a shareable C library.
