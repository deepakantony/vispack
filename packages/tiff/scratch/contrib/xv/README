This directory contains modifications to the XV 2.00 distribution
for supporting TIFF.  Two new files (xvtiff.c and xvtiffwr.c)
and patches to existing files are provided.  The modified Imakefile
assumes that a libtiff subdirectory exists in the xv directory --
I use a symbolic link.

FYI, XV 2.00 is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu
in the directory packages/X/contrib.
